# NIQAnalyst

A proof of concept for loan auto decision analysis and credit memo generation via ChatGPT

## Accessing the Application

The project is hosted here: https://phillipbyram-ncino.github.io/nIQAnalyst/
To enable generative results, you must set your OpenAI Secret key in localStorage under an API_KEY entry.
After navigating to the above link, open your browser console and run this command like so:
```
localStorage.setItem('API_KEY', 'sk-...abcd')
```
Replacing the 'sk-...abcd' with your personal secret key from OpenAI.

Obviously you shouldnt do this if you don't trust me or if you haven't read through the code to confirm that I'm not stealing your key ðŸ˜›
